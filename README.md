A social media based platform for planning and organizing trips with friends. 

This was originally a project I built with a team during my time at Makersquare. I am rebuilding it from scratch to relearn
Node and to teach myself React. I also want to experiment with UI/UX design, test driven development, devops/deployment, and
project management.

There will be both client and server directories. The server will be Node (maybe Express) and will use a PostgreSQL database.
The data is best handled with a relational database, and PostgreSQL was chosen because it will be easiest to integrate with 
Heroku, my chosen hosting solution for this project. Heroku was chosen because of familiarity and cost (free).

The front end will be built with React. Since I'm not familiar with React, I'm not sure of the best architecture to 
implement, since React is not a full MVC framework.
